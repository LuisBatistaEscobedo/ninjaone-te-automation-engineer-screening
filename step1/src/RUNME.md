## How To Run

This demo consist on two simple files that contain all the necessary code to do a basic execution of the Knapsack problem.

First step is to ensure that Java is installed on the current environment and all the necessary tools are setup; here's a quick [guide](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/How-do-I-install-Java-on-Windows).


## Easiest Way to Execute

Ideally, the console on any source-code editor as Visual Studio Code should be able to execute our MainClass which execute our KnapsackClass and has all the methods created. Is just a matter of open our MainClass and click on Run Java Program.


## ... A More Complicated Solution

Another solution, is to use our console or cmd to execute our MainClass, which require a little more steps, but is not a big deal.

- First step is to copy our two classes; MainClass.java and KnapsackClass.java to a different folder.
- Once on this folder, open a cmd or Terminal on this folder directory.
- We execute the command `javac MainClass.java` and as a result two folder should be created: `MainClass.class` and `KnapsackClass.class`
- Next is to execute the command `java MainClass` and the code should be executing on our console.
